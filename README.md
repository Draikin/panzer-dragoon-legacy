Installing Locally
------------------

This guide assumes that you already have Git, Ruby, RubyGems, and Bundler
installed on your development machine.

You will also need to install ImageMagick for file attachments and PostgreSQL
for the database. SQLite may be used in development for simplicity.

```
git clone https://github.com/chrisalley/the-will-of-the-ancients.git
cd the-will-of-the-ancients
cp config/examples/database.yml config/database.yml
cp config/examples/secrets.yml config/secrets.yml
bundle
rake db:schema:load
rails s
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 to view the website. If you previously
installed a copy of the website with a different dataset you may need to clear
your browser cookies.

Publishing Code Changes
-----------------------

Before changes are committed, ensure that all automated tests are passing:

```
rspec
```

Once code changes are ready to be published, commit and push to the master
branch (or create a pull request if you don't have permission).

```
git add -A
git commit -m "Update the website with new awesome changes"
git push origin master
```

Now deploy the changes from origin with Capistrano:

```
cap deploy
```

If there are database migrations to be applied, use:

```
cap deploy:migrations
```
